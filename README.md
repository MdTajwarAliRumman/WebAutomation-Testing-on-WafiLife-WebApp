# 📚 WafiLife Website Automation Testing Project

## 📝 Project Information
I conducted comprehensive Manual and Automation Testing across multiple endpoints, modules, and features of the website to ensure overall system stability and reliability. The primary testing areas covered were the Login/Signup module, Product purchasing flow, Author selection, Homepage dynamic sections, Menu and Search functionality, Book Fair section with its products, along with several other integrated components.

The objective of this testing effort was to validate that all critical modules were functioning according to requirements and remained free from defects. To achieve this, I performed Integration Testing to check the data flow and communication between different modules, ensuring that interdependencies were working seamlessly. Additionally, I carried out both Positive and Negative Testing to identify potential edge cases and confirm system robustness under various scenarios.

Beyond functional validation, my testing process also focused on end-to-end user journeys, making sure that the overall experience, from login to product purchase, aligned with the expected outcomes. The entire automation process was executed using TestNG, and a structured TestNG XML Report was generated to provide detailed insights into the testing coverage, execution results, and identified issues. 

The main goal of this project was to verify that all major modules and areas of the website are functioning as expected and are free from critical bugs. To achieve this:
- 🤖 I performed **Automation Testing** on different modules to ensure efficiency and consistency in the testing process.  
- ✅ I validated **Integration Testing** by checking the data flow between modules.  
- ✅ I performed **Positive and Negative Testing** to identify potential issues.  
- 📝 Finally, I generated a **TestNG XML Report**, which illustrates the overall testing process for the website.
